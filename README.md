# 4. Building

At the moment, TDengine server supports running on Linux/Windows/MacOS systems. Any application can also choose the RESTful interface provided by taosAdapter to connect the taosd service. TDengine supports X64/ARM64 CPU, and it will support MIPS64, Alpha64, ARM32, RISC-V and other CPU architectures in the future. Right now we don't support build with cross-compiling environment.

You can choose to install through source code, [container](https://docs.tdengine.com/get-started/docker/), [installation package](https://docs.tdengine.com/get-started/package/) or [Kubernetes](https://docs.tdengine.com/deployment/k8s/). This quick guide only applies to installing from source.

TDengine provide a few useful tools such as taosBenchmark (was named taosdemo) and taosdump. They were part of TDengine. By default, TDengine compiling does not include taosTools. You can use `cmake .. -DBUILD_TOOLS=true` to make them be compiled with TDengine.

To build TDengine, use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.13.0 or higher versions in the project directory.

## 4.1 Linux platform building

You can run the bash script `build.sh` to build both TDengine and taosTools including taosBenchmark and taosdump as below:

```bash
./build.sh
```

It equals to execute following commands:

```bash
mkdir debug
cd debug
cmake .. -DBUILD_TOOLS=true -DBUILD_CONTRIB=true
make
```

You can use Jemalloc as memory allocator instead of glibc:

```
apt install autoconf
cmake .. -DJEMALLOC_ENABLED=true
```

TDengine build script can detect the host machine's architecture on X86-64, X86, arm64 platform.
You can also specify CPUTYPE option like aarch64 too if the detection result is not correct:

aarch64:

```bash
cmake .. -DCPUTYPE=aarch64 && cmake --build .
```

## 4.2 Windows platform building

If you use the Visual Studio 2013, please open a command window by executing "cmd.exe".
Please specify "amd64" for 64 bits Windows or specify "x86" for 32 bits Windows when you execute vcvarsall.bat.

```cmd
mkdir debug && cd debug
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" < amd64 | x86 >
cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles"
nmake
```

If you use the Visual Studio 2019 or 2017:

please open a command window by executing "cmd.exe".
Please specify "x64" for 64 bits Windows or specify "x86" for 32 bits Windows when you execute vcvarsall.bat.

```cmd
mkdir debug && cd debug
"c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" < x64 | x86 >
cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles"
nmake
```

Or, you can simply open a command window by clicking Windows Start -> "Visual Studio < 2019 | 2017 >" folder -> "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS < 2019 | 2017 >" or "x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS < 2019 | 2017 >" depends what architecture your Windows is, then execute commands as follows:

```cmd
mkdir debug && cd debug
cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles"
nmake
```

## 4.3 MacOS platform building

Please install XCode command line tools and cmake. Verified with XCode 11.4+ on Catalina and Big Sur.

```shell
mkdir debug && cd debug
cmake .. && cmake --build .
```

# 6. Installation

## 6.1 Linux platform installation

After building successfully, TDengine can be installed by

```bash
sudo make install
```

Users can find more information about directories installed on the system in the [directory and files](https://docs.tdengine.com/reference/directory/) section.

Installing from source code will also configure service management for TDengine.Users can also choose to [install from packages](https://docs.tdengine.com/get-started/package/) for it.

## 6.2 Windows platform installation

After building successfully, TDengine can be installed by:

```cmd
nmake install
```

## 6.3 MacOS platform installation

After building successfully, TDengine can be installed by:

```bash
sudo make install
```

Users can find more information about directories installed on the system in the [directory and files](https://docs.tdengine.com/reference/directory/) section.

Installing from source code will also configure service management for TDengine.Users can also choose to [install from packages](https://docs.tdengine.com/get-started/package/) for it.

To start the service after installation, double-click the /applications/TDengine to start the program, or in a terminal, use:

```bash
sudo launchctl start com.tdengine.taosd
```

Then users can use the TDengine CLI to connect the TDengine server. In a terminal, use:

```bash
taos
```

If TDengine CLI connects the server successfully, welcome messages and version info are printed. Otherwise, an error message is shown.

# 7. Running

## 7.1 Linux platform

To start the service after installation, in a terminal, use:

```bash
sudo systemctl start taosd
```

Then users can use the TDengine CLI to connect the TDengine server. In a terminal, use:

```bash
taos
```

If TDengine CLI connects the server successfully, welcome messages and version info are printed. Otherwise, an error message is shown.

If you don't want to run TDengine as a service, you can run it in current shell. For example, to quickly start a TDengine server after building, run the command below in terminal: (We take Linux as an example, command on Windows will be `taosd.exe`)

```bash
./build/bin/taosd -c test/cfg
```

In another terminal, use the TDengine CLI to connect the server:

```bash
./build/bin/taos -c test/cfg
```

option "-c test/cfg" specifies the system configuration file directory.
