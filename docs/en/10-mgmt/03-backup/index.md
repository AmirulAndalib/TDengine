TDengine Cloud provides full support for data backup. Customers can backup data from a database of the current TDengine Cloud instance, or restore data from backup files already stored in TDengine Cloud to the database of the current TDengine Cloud instance.

Customers just need to click the **Create New Backup** button to open the dialog for creating a new backup task. Firstly, in the **Backup Cycle** selection, choose how often TDengine Cloud backs up the data, you can choose **Every Day**, **Every 7 Days**, or **Every 30 Days**, and then select the database of the current TDengine Cloud in the **Database** selection. Finally click the **Create** button to create a data backup task.
