description: This document describes how to configure users and user groups to access your TDengine Cloud instance.
---

TDengine Cloud instances can be configured to allow access to users and user groups. Customers only need to go to the **Users for this Instance** tab and then configure the specified resources for these users to access the current instance, including the roles to read/write databases in the instance, manage the instance and so on, also the expiration time of these roles. Customers can also go to the **User Groups for this Instance** tab to configure the specified resources with privileges to access the current instance for the user groups, including roles to read/write to the database inside the instance, manage the instance and so on, also the expiration time of these roles.

For the users and user groups that have been added to allow access to the current instance, customers can remove these users and user groups from the current instance, and can also pause or remove the access for the specified users or user groups at any time.
