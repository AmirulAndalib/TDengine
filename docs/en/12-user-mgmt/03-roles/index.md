On the **Roles** tab page, TDengine Cloud lists all the roles in the current organization, including eight default roles, such as Database Admin, Finance, Data Writer, Data Reader, Developer, Instance Admin, Super Admin, and Organization Owner. There are also so four levels of privileges, such as organization level, instance level, database level, and grant privilege level.

Customers can click the **Add New Role** button at the top right of the organization list to open the **Add New Role** dialog. In the dialog that opens, you must first enter the name of the new role, and then in the **Privileges** section, select the privileges that include Organization, Instance, Database or Grant privileges. Finally, click the **Create** button and the new role is created.

Customers who have created a customized role can edit its name and specific privileges by clicking on the **Edit** button to the left of the role name, or you can delete the customized role.
