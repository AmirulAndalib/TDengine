You can modify your personal information, including name, password and phone number.

## MFA

MFA, also known as multi-factor authentication, can protect you from credential loss or theft and data destruction. By default, the MFA function is enabled for the operations in the list, and you need to enter the MFA verification code each time you operate.

In order to avoid repeated email verification during batch operations, you can temporarily disable the MFA function for specific operations on the MFA page.

1. On the MFA edit page, check the `Disable MFA` in the operation column, and set the duration of the disable MFA, click `Save` to close the MFA function.

2. Closing the MFA operation requires email verification. After the verification is successful, the MFA function will be temporarily disabled within the set time.

3. When an operation requiring MFA verification is performed during the period of closing the MFA function, MFA verification will not be performed.

4. When logging in on a new device and during the period of closing the MFA function, the first operation requiring MFA verification still needs to be verified by MFA.
