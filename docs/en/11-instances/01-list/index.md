This section lists all instances created by the current organization of TDengine Cloud. Each instance shows its alias, region, token, URL, price plan, basic status and other information.

Users can perform a lot of operations on each instance, such as editing the instance alias, stopping the instance, deleting the instance, and upgrading the price plan for the current instance. You can also copy the access token of each instance to the system clipboard. If the instance is configured with a private link, the private URL will also be displayed here.

:::note Important

When stopping or deleting an instance, the system will ask the user to confirm the verification code twice by default, only by entering the verification code in the relevant email sent to the user's mailbox can the corresponding operation be carried out.
